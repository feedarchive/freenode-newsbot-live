r/wallstreetbets:50+,[DD] There are two ways to build the biggest building in town. One is by actually building the biggest building in town ($RKT) and the other way is by tearing all of the other buildings down ($UWMC). Actually building the biggest building historically wins in the end which is why I'm betting on $RKT,https://redd.it/o1jb86,
